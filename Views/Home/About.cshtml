    <p class="lead">Welcome to our Cinema WebApp </p>

    <p>This web application was designed to simulate a real-world cinema management system. The goal was to apply what weâ€™ve learned about web development, databases, and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture using ASP.NET Core.</p>

    <p>With this project, we aimed to create a clean and easy-to-use platform where users can:</p>
    <ul class="text-start d-inline-block">
        <li>Browse available movies with details</li>
        <li>View screening times</li>
        <li>Create accounts and log in as different roles (Admin, Content Admin, Customer)</li>
        <li>Manage content and bookings based on user roles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While it's still a learning project, we tried to make it as realistic and functional as possible. We hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed building it.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><em>Thank you for visiting!</em></p>
